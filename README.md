# OrbHive
An old school side-scrolling shooter, with GameBoy's monocromatic graphics style.

Built for fun, to practice Java and learn LibGDX.

IDEA Injelij: on settings/build/compiler/JavaCompiler:
Requires bytecode target 7 for core module. Thats because of import of ThreadLocalRandom class on Random Int generation.
